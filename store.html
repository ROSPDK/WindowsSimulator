    "Message": "Nashville (previously Cleveland), popularly known as Windows 96 by contemporary press, was the codename for a cancelled release of Microsoft Windows scheduled to be released in 1996, between \"Chicago\" (Windows 95) and \"Memphis\" (Windows 98, at the time scheduled for release in 1996, later 1997). Nashville was intended to be a minor release focusing on a tighter integration between Windows and Internet Explorer, in order to better compete with Netscape Navigator.",
